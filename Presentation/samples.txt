1. Normal
I'm really looking forward to our trip next weekend.

Just finished a great book and now I'm feeling inspired!

Work's been busy, but I feel accomplished.

I love spending time with my family and friends.

Woke up early, made coffee, and watched the sunrise.

I had a good day today. Nothing special, just peaceful.

I enjoy cooking new recipes when I have time.

Things are going well — not perfect, but I feel content.

I’m learning a new skill, and I’m proud of the progress I’ve made so far.

Life has its ups and downs, but I’m generally grateful for where I’m at and what I’ve achieved.

2. Depression
I feel tired all the time, even after sleeping.

It's like there's a heavy cloud I can't escape.

I can’t find joy in the things I used to love.

Getting out of bed feels impossible some mornings.

Everything feels pointless lately — I don't know why.

I feel like I'm just going through the motions of life.

People say "cheer up," but they don't understand how numb I feel.

My energy is gone, and even small tasks feel overwhelming.

I smile in front of others, but inside I feel completely empty.

Each day feels like I'm carrying the weight of the world with no one noticing or helping, and I'm not sure how much longer I can pretend everything is okay.

3. Suicidal
I don't want to wake up tomorrow.

The pain is too much, and I can't take it anymore.

I feel like everyone would be better off without me.

I think about ending it every day now.

Nothing makes sense anymore — I'm done trying.

It's not that I want to die, I just don't want to live like this.

I keep writing goodbye notes in my head.

I'm exhausted, and no one notices how much I'm struggling inside.

I’ve planned it out more times than I’d like to admit, and that scares me.

I’m not asking for attention; I’m begging for the pain to stop, because living in this constant state of hopelessness feels worse than dying.

4. Others (Anxiety, Bipolar, Stress, Personality Disorder)
My heart races even when there's nothing to be afraid of.

I can’t focus — my mind jumps from one thought to another.

One moment I’m on top of the world, and the next I’m crying in bed.

Stress keeps building and I don’t know how to let go.

People tell me I'm too much, but I just feel too broken.

I rehearse conversations in my head over and over again.

Sometimes I feel like I’m two different people in one body.

My mood changes so fast, I can’t keep up with myself.

I’m constantly worried that something bad is going to happen, even when things are fine.

I wish people understood how exhausting it is to battle your own mind while trying to appear normal on the outside every single day.
